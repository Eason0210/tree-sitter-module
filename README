!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I should clarify that this module is NOT a standalone tree-sitter
module. It is supossed to be used with an upcoming tree-sitter
intergration in Emacs core.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To build the dynamic module for a particular tree-sitter language
definition, run

    ./build.sh <language>

e.g.,

    ./build.sh html

The dynamic module will be in dist directory

To build all modules at once, run

    ./batch.sh

==================== Update ====================

Now the tree-sitter intergration directly loads language definition
libraries (instead of Emacs modules), to build a shared library, run

    ./build-new.sh <language>

To build all libraries at one, run

    ./batch-new.sh
